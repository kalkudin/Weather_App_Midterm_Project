## Weather Feature

The application starts with displaying the weather for the given user location. if the user has not granted the application permission to use their location, it will be re-asked againa at this point. the information provided includes the current day, temperature for midday,
humidity, windspeed and the general description of the weather. this is done by using a utility class WeatherType which is built based on weather codes provided by the api, which determines the description and the icon to use for a given weather.
